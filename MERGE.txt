Apache Tomcat重用了许多其他Apache项目的代码。
有几个原因可以解释为什么依赖于这些项目的二进制版本并不理想。 这些包括：
- 如果Web应用程序附带相同的JAR，则可能发生冲突
- Tomcat只依赖于一小部分的大型JAR


SVN
===

For sources hosted in svn the approach is to svn copy the classes to the Tomcat
source tree, modify them (always with a package rename, sometimes with
additional changes) and then keep them in sync with the original via regular svn
merges. This file keeps track of these copies to assist committers in keeping
them up to date.

BCEL
----
org.apache.tomcat.util.bcel is copied from:
/commons/proper/bcel/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/bcel

Codec
-----
org.apache.tomcat.util.codec is copied from:
/commons/proper/codec/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/
Note: Only classes required for Base64 encoding/decoding. The rest are removed.


GIT
===

Updates from Git are applied manually via patch files. Patch files are generated
using:
git diff <last SHA1>:<sub-tree> HEAD:<sub-tree> > temp.patch
The most recently merged SHA1 for the component below should be updated after
the patch file has been applied and committed

FileUpload
----------
Sub-tree:
src/main/java/org/apache/commons/fileupload
The SHA1 ID for the most recent commit to be merged to Tomcat is:
6c00d575a9521c386743891fd34bc5181174cc01

Note: Tomcat's copy of fileupload also includes classes copied manually (rather
      than svn copied) from Commons IO.

DBCP
----
DBCP2
Sub-tree
/commons/proper/dbcp/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/dbcp2
/commons/proper/dbcp/trunk/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/dbcp2
The SHA1 ID for the most recent commit to be merged to Tomcat is:
8a71764a895b234bd1fc76553835ef4c974f22e1

Pool2
Sub-tree
src/main/java/org/apache/commons/pool2
The SHA1 ID for the most recent commit to be merged to Tomcat is:
191a391166a8565718ef685531afa3fa44afd69c
